this program is designated to estimate probabilities of occurence of different
playing situations in TexasHoldem Poker card game

the program does Monte-Carlo simulation of 65535 shuffles and dealings (this 
number is maximal for AX IntelCPU registry) and estimates probabilites of 
several events for "preflop", "flop", "turn" and "river"

this progam runs in terminal - no GUI (sorry)

requirements:

  - unix/linux x86-64 Intel/AMD

in your system must be installed the next programs:

  - ld             loader
  - gcc            gnu compiler with assembler compiler 'as' (AT&T syntax) 
  - gmake/make     utility
  - bash           shell 
  - awk            report tool                https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/ 
  - sed            stream editor              https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/
  - od             oct, dec, hex, ASCII dump  https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/

(usually all these programs are supplied by default)

no "installation" - soft will work in the current dir

to compile source files into exec files:

  $> make

in terminal

to start program: 

  $> ./dispatch 
  
output would be done to stdout

to change level up:  Ctrl-D
to exit:             Ctrl-C
