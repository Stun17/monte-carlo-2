this program is designated to estimate probabilities of occurence of different
playing situations in TexasHoldem Poker card game

the program does Monte-Carlo simulation of 65535 shuffles and dealings (this 
number is maximal for 16-bit AX Intel i686 CPU register) and estimates 
the probabilites of several events for "preflop", "flop", "turn" and "river"

the purgpose - to test different coincidences of own pocket with deck and with 
other players pockets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this progam runs in terminal - no GUI (sorry)


system requirements:

  - unix/linux x86-64 Intel/AMD

in your system must be installed the next programs:

  - ld             loader                     https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/ 
  - as             assembler compiler         https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/ 
  - gmake/make     utility                    https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
  - bash           unix-shell                 https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
  - awk            report tool                https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/ 
  - od             oct, dec, hex, ASCII dump  https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/

usually in Linux realm all these programs are supplied by default

thats all - no libraries, only system calls are used

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

no "installation" - program works in the current dir 

to compile source files into exec files:

  $> make

in terminal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to start program: 

  $> ./dispatch.sh 
  
output would be done to stdout

to change level up:  Ctrl-D
to exit:             Ctrl-C

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if you wish completely uninstall it - just delete that project dir. thats all!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enjoy!
